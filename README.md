<h2>Note to developers</h2>
1.) There is no need installing node and bower components. <br>
2.) I used semantic just for practice purposes only. Semantic UI requires jquery which is not supported by angular and the angular friendly version of semantic is not production ready yet(I guess).
<br>
3.) For faster development on angularjs i would recommend fuse(http://fuse-angular-material.withinpixels.com/dashboard-project).
